# Food Fine Calculator

A calculator to help myself deal with the food fine collection matters in Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) Boarding School.

The calculator takes care of all the boarders' deposits and debts. The user just needs to key in how many breakfast / lunch / dinner that each boarder skips when fining him, and how much each boarder pays in cash when the boarder is paying off his debt.
